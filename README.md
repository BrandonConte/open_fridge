## Open Fridge

In this repository, you can find a <a href="">live</a> url deployment of a fully functioning recipe and nutritional value lookup. Upon visitng the web address, you may enter in a food, ingredient or complete dish that you like and it will display that set of ingredients and nutritional values so that the user understands what they are consuming.

## Our goal

We wanted to create a simple, useful daily app that anyone can use. This is especially helpful during our time where working from home is getting normalized.
