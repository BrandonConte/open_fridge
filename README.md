## HOW TO USE

In this repository, you can find a [live](https://paperpatch.github.io/open_fridge/) url deployment of a fully functioning recipe and nutritional value lookup. Upon visitng the web address, you may search for a recipe dish that you would like to make. It will display a set of recipes for you to choose from. Clicking on an image will display a set of instructions and nutritional values from the recipe.
<br/>
<br/>
When a specific recipe dish is selected, the name of the dish will be appended on the `[Recent Recipes]` list on the left navigation bar. Data is stored and transferred via localStorage.
